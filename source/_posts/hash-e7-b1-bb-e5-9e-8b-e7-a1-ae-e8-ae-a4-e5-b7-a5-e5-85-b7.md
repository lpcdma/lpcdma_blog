Description:    HashTag.py is a python script written to parse and identify password hashes.  It has three main arguments which consist of identifying a single hash type (-sh), parsing and identifying multiple hashes from a file (-f), and traversing subdirectories to locate files which contain hashes  and parse/identify them (-d).
