inSSIDer 2

The only free tool of its kind...
Wi - Fi network scanners have been around for some time. InSSIDer is a free software designed to work with Windows. The software is advanced enough to run on 64 bit Windows which is a very positive part of this software’s functionality. Most other wireless scanners don’t work well with Windows Vista and Windows 7 and cannot show more than one channel or SSID at a time. By showing all of your SSIDs, you can get a great view of your wireless network as you walk around and perform a wireless survey.
With inSSIDer, anyone can see all of the channels, SSIDs and signal strengths. The software separates wireless signals with colors. This software is truly developed for the current generation wireless geeks
InSSIDer uses native Wi-Fi API creating a program that recognizes a majority of wireless cards that are available. 
One of the best features is the ability to group these wireless signals by MAC Address, SSID, Channels, and RSSI.
